<h1>Sprites</h1>
	
<article class="textbox">
	<p>So sprite icons are a super nifty and useable thing. If you think about it, images are easier for the brain to interpret, and also isn't dependent on language. Take for example this:</p>

	<i class="icon-home"></i>
	<i class="icon-home-hover"></i>
	
	<p>Odds are you can tell what it is super easily. Using some basic logic, it will take you to a home page, or base site. Or these:</p>

	<ul>
			<li><a href="#" class="icon-back"><span>Page Back</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="#" class="icon-group"><span>Check out the group</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="#" class="icon-contact"><span>Contact Us</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="#" class="icon-next"><span>Next Page</span></a></li>
			
		</ul>

	<p>Put these things on just about any web page, and it's pretty obvious what each of these should represent. And don't they just look so much better than just plain black icons? Or even just words? Like dang son, look how classy, colorful, and even matching an ongoing theme for a webpage these things can be. And not just for navigaion, but even for links to outside sources.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com" class="icon-facebook" target="zuckerberg"><span>Facebook</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com" class="icon-twitter" target="bird"><span>Twitter</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com" class="icon-reddit" target="something"><span>Reddit</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="#" class="icon-snapchat"><span>Snapchat</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com" class="icon-youtube" target="cats"><span>YouTube</span></a></li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>If you've ever used the internet, you've most likely seen these sprites at least a few times before, and this will be far from your last. By using clear and iconic images, it's clear what each of these will do, especially as links. Click one, you'll be taken to the coresponding social media page (note, these ones won't, they are only examples).</p>

	Just to get things clear on how easy this is to do, I made all those sprites after having a few pretty strong drinks. Not bad, if I say so myself.
